# Binary-Search-Tree
# A program demonstrating simple operations in a Binary search tree, an important data structure in programming.
A Binary Search Tree is an important data structure which is used in wide areas of Computer science. 
# 1. A binary tree is a tree-type non-linear data structure with a maximum of two children for each parent. Every node in a binary tree has a left and right reference along with the data element. The node at the top of the hierarchy of a tree is called the root node.

Following Image gives an idea about a binary tree:

# Now a binary search tree is basically a binary tree with sorted or ordered elements(nodes)

To be clear, all the elements or sub-nodes which are lesser than the root node will be stored to the left of the root node whereas those greater than the root node will be stored to the right of the root node. The following illustration depicts the working of a binary search tree and how it is different from a binary tree:-

Binary Search Trees serve as an important purpose for many operations in computation and are preferred over Hashing in some cases where the order of the elements matters.
